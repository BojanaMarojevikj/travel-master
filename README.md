This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This app serves as a travel itinerary generator. The user enters information like dates and destination about a trip and with that information a travel itinerary is generated. In order for the itinerary generator to work you need to insert your own OpenAI API key in `app/generate-itinerary/TravelForm.tsx`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
